# log_parser
A sample web server log parser<br/>
This is implemented using ruby 2.3.1<br/>
The parser takes a log file (.log extension only) and counts the total and unique occurences of each page visit. It displays them in descending order.<br/>
Following gem is used to pretty format output on console<br>
